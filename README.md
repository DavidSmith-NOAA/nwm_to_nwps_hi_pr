Short Range NWM Informed NWPS Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts for visualizing Shorte Range National Water Model (NWM) Informed NWPS data for Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The generated plots help visualize water model data for effective hydrological analysis.

Features

Generate separate maps for Hawaii and Puerto Rico

Visualize NWM and NWPS data with color-coded markers

Customizable map settings for detailed analysis

Installation
